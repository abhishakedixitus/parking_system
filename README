PROJECT: "SAVE MY SPOT"
**************************************************************************
SUMMARY
**************************************************************************
When you live in or have visited a major city, you know that finding a 
parking spot isnâ€™t just hard; it is going to be expensive. Moreover, time
spent looking for someplace to put your car on crowded city street is 
significant. One 2011 IBM study found that 30 percent of a major city's 
traffic is  attributable to people hunting for parking with an average 
of 20 minutes spent in looking for convenient parking space. To scale 
down this problem, our web application records user location and allows 
them to find and compare empty parking spots near them from an extensive 
and accurate parking database; saving money and time when you park. It
will also allow users to pre-book a parking space right from home, so 
they never have to worry about losing their desired spot.

SETUP
**************************************************************************
1.When the code is executed once, it creates a default keyspace 'ParkingSystem'. 
If the code is to be re-run, the keyspace 'ParkingSystem' has to be dropped 
manually otherwise it will result in keyspace conflict.
